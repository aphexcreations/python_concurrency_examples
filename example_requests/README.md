Python-Request Concurrency Example
==================================

This demonstrates the ability to use python-requests calls
from within Gevent threads. This is actually not the ideal
way to run concurrent requests, but in some cases it is necessary.

For information on running native concurrent requests using in
python-requests, see
[The Async Module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#asynchronous-requests).

To run this demonstration, run the `./run_client.py` script.
